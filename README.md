## Overview

  An age calculator that calculated your age by adding your day of birth.

### The challenge
Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

-   Understanding the task;
-   Separate it into smaller tasks (if possible), then solve them one by one.

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Working with dates in JavaScript can be difficult and tedious, especially if you aren't using any library. Thqnks tonthe challenge, no I know thr basic functionality of Date.now(), getMonth(), getDate() etc. , but still need more practice.
- Using first time *getComputedStyle* and *getPropertyValue* and understanding how tonise them was really nice.


### Continued development

-   I'm continuing my journey of becoming better frontend developer.
-   Need more practice with JS, CSS (grid and flex), and HTML (for SEO);
-   I have to optimize my CSS better.
-   Practicing dates, time stamps etc.
